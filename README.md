# Godbound Foundry Module

An incomplete (but usable!) Foundry system module for running Godbound games. The most recent release is compatible with Foundry v10, while v0.89 is the version you will want if you are still using Foundry v9.

## Dependencies

The following modules are strongly recommended for playing using this system in Foundry v10, though not required:
* PDF Pager
* Combat Tracker Groups

When properly configured, the PDF Pager module allows you to click the PDF icon next to a Word, opening the PDF to the page of the Word for reference. Note that this system DOES NOT come with the Godbound PDF(s), and you must own it yourself in order to upload it as a Journal Entry. Make sure when you upload your Godbound PDFs as Journal Entries to use the PDF codes CORE (for the core rulebook), LEXICON (for Lexicon of the Throne), and HOMEBREW (for Homebrew Words, if you are including them in your game), as well as Page Offset of 2 for the Core Rulebook and Lexicon of the Throne. If you would like a copy of the PDF that contains the Jungle and Martyr homebrew words, you may contact me on Discord (sarah#0911) and I will gladly send it to you.

The Combat Tracker Groups module allows you to appoximate Godbound's initiative system by grouping all PC actors and NPC actors to act on the same 'turn' in combat. I plan on adding a system-specific initiative override eventually, but that's a future project and not a current priority.

## Incomplete Features

The following features are not mechanically supported by this system at this time:
* Strifes
* Low magic
* Damage automation
* Initiative (as written in the core book)
* Singular attack rolls with multiple targets (since most AOEs are save against, this is not a big deal, but might affect niche cases)
